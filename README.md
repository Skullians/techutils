# Technical Utilities

Tech Utils is a mod providing client-side tweaks for [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica), [WorldEdit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit) and other small utilities.

## Mod config
To access mod config open [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and select this mod.

## Features

- Inventory Verifier addon to Litematica's Schematic Verifier  
  - Conveniently displays the difference between the expected and found inventory contents side-by-side.  
  - Has semantic slot highlighting (view feature `inventoryScreenOverlay` further down).  
  - Turning on `verifyItemComponents` will require item components to match and will also visualize them in the item tooltip for you to compare.  
  - Enables schematic creators to use [item predicates](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Template:Nbt_inherit/conditions/item/template) - a flexible way to specify what properties items should have. [Here's](https://misode.github.io/predicate/?share=3lvOcqP7xk) an impractical but exhaustive example via Misode's handy generator.

  *This feature only works if your server has [Servux](https://modrinth.com/mod/servux), or you have nbt query permissions (e.g. by being an operator or installing a permissions mod/plugin), or you're in Singleplayer.*


- Sync WorldEdit selection  
  Snap WorldEdit region to active Litematica selection - `autoWeSync`.  
  *Region synchronizes shortly after you modify a selection, showing you a confirmation message above the hotbar.*

- Image selection dialog for litematica preview:  
  Set litematic preview image to one you select, which unlike the 3D preview feature will be shown to any player, even without this mod.  
  *In main Litematica menu go to Schematic Manager, select a litematic and ctrl + click on Set Preview button to open the prompt.*

- Inventory setup preview:  
  Show items that have to be in a container and highlights wrong or mismatched ones - `inventoryScreenOverlay`.  
  *Item colors match your placement block colors. By default its:  
  - Light blue: missing item;  
  - Orange: mismatched amount or nbt data;  
  - Magenta: extra item that shouldn't be present;  
  - Red: wrong item type.*

- Compact scoreboard (ported from my old mod) - `compactScoreboard`.  
  Using short number format:
  - 1000 -> 1k
  - 1000000 -> 1M
  - 1000000000 -> 1B
- Disable WorldEdit neighbor updates on log-in - `autoDisableUpdates`.
- Hotkeys for litematic placement rotation & mirror - `rotatePlacement` and `mirrorPlacement`.
- `/isorender selection` shortcut for rendering current Litematica selection in [Isometric Renders](https://modrinth.com/mod/isometric-renders).
- A hotkey to give yourself a container full of the item you're holding - `giveFullInv`. Supports boxes, chests, and bundles. Nesting them is possible.
- A hotkey to refresh the material list - `refreshMaterialList`.
- Make easy place act as if all blocks are full blocks. Useful for placing blocks with small hit boxes.
- *And more to come!*
